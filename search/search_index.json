(If we offered to pay for your hotel room, we will pay for the six nights of the schedule.)\n\n\nFind the numbered section below that applies to you:\n\n\n1. We Offered to Pay for Your Travel\n\n\nWe budgeted an \naverage\n of $525 per participant for travel to and from Madison (except in cases of flying internationally or driving from nearby). Many travelers will find good options for less than that amount, and some will have to go over that amount. Our goal is to have everyone find a reasonable travel itinerary and not exceed our overall budget.\n\n\nWhen looking for a reasonable and cost-effective means to travel to and from Madison, here are a few ideas:\n\n\n\n\nWithin about 5 hours driving of Madison, consider driving or taking a bus; we can support \nall\n kinds of travel\n\n\nIf you fly, be flexible (within reason) about departure times \u2014 early and late flights are often the least expensive\n\n\nConsider flying into Milwaukee (1\u00bd hours away) or Chicago (2\u00bd hours away) and taking a direct bus to/from Madison (details below)\n\n\n\n\nIn any case, try to complete your travel plans by early June, before rates go up significantly.\n\n\nSee below for details about each travel mode:\n\n\nTravel by Airplane\n\n\nDo NOT buy your own airline tickets\n. University rules require the University\u2019s travel agency, Fox World Travel (FWT), to purchase your tickets.\n\n\nTo arrange flights to/from Madison:\n\n\n\n\nPrepare your travel information, requirements, and preferences:\n\n\nBasic personal information, including full legal name (as on government IDs), date of birth, and possibly a phone number\n\n\nTravel requirements, including starting and ending airport(s), hard timing constraints \u2014 preferences, such as not \nliking\n early flights, are different than hard constraints!\n\n\nTravel preferences, including timing preferences, airplane seating locations, and so forth \nIf you wish, you may search for (\nbut not purchase\n) flights ahead of time for your own information \u2014 but note that FWT may find different flights or may see different costs, and all tickets must be purchased by FWT and follow UW rules.\n \nIf flights to/from Madison are expensive, the FWT agent may check flights to/from Milwaukee or Chicago and bus schedules from those airports to Madison:\n\n\nBus between \nMitchell Airport\n (MKE) in Milwaukee and downtown Madison: \nBadger Bus\n (~$20 each way)\n\n\nBus between \nO\u2019Hare Airport\n (ORD) in Chicago and downtown Madison: \nVan Galder Bus\n (~$30 each way)\n\n\nBus between \nMidway Airport\n (MDW) in Chicago and downtown Madison: \nVan Galder Bus\n (~$30 each way) 2. \nContact Fox World Travel\n\n\nBy phone:\n Within the United States, use 866-230-8787 and select option 4; internationally, use +1\u00a0920-230-6467 and select option 4. \nTell them that you are part of Group Code 09UW1028.\n Agents are available Monday through Friday, 7:00 a.m. until 5:30 p.m. U.S. Central Time.\n\n\nBy email:\n Send to \n and \ninclude Group Code 09UW1028\n in the subject line.\n 3. \nIn most cases, FWT will need to get our approval for your itinerary before completing the purchase, so it may take up to a day to get final confirmation. Airplane seats cannot be held without purchase over a weekend, so it is best to avoid contacting FWT late on Fridays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n If you are including bus tickets as part of your flying itinerary, you may purchase them through FWT when you arrange your flights, or for maximum flexibility purchase them from bus drivers on the day of travel.\n\n\nTravel by Bus\n\n\nTypically, reasonable bus options \u2014 i.e., those that do not take an excessive amount of time to reach Madison \u2014 cost much less than air options.\n\n\nNote that you may purchase bus tickets through Fox World Travel (see above in the Travel by Airplane section) or yourself \nbefore or on\n the day of travel. If you purchase your own tickets, you must get our approval for the estimated cost first, then request reimbursement from us after the School.\n\n\nWhen you purchase your own tickets, save the original receipt (even if by email). It would be best if the ticket contains the following information, but a regular ticket stub (e.g., without your name or date) should work fine. Just get what you can! If possible, we would like:\n\n\n\n\nComplete itinerary\n\n\nYour name\n\n\nDate of purchase\n\n\nTotal amount paid\n\n\n\n\nBe sure to email us with your travel plans as soon as possible. Try to include:\n\n\n\n\nTransportation provider(s) (e.g., Van Galder bus)\n\n\nArrival date and approximate time\n\n\nDeparture date and approximate time\n\n\nArrival and departure location within Madison\n\n\nActual or estimated cost (indicate which)\n\n\n\n\nTravel by Personal Car\n\n\nIf you are driving to Madison, you will be reimbursed the mileage rate of $0.535/mile for the round-trip distance (as calculated by Google Maps), plus tolls. Also, we will pay for parking costs for the week at the hotel in Madison (but not elsewhere). It may help to keep your receipts for tolls.\n\n\nNote: Due to the high mileage reimbursement rate, driving can be an expensive option! We reserve the right to limit your total driving reimbursement, so work with us on the details.\n\n\nTo travel by personal car, please check with us first. We may search for comparable flight options, to make sure that driving is indeed the least expensive method.\n\n\nBe sure to email us with your travel plans as soon as possible.
