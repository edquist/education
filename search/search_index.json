(If we offered to pay for your hotel room, we will pay for the six nights of the schedule.)\n\n\nFind the numbered section below that applies to you:\n\n\n1. We Offered to Pay for Your Travel\n\n\nWe budgeted an \naverage\n of $525 per participant for travel to and from Madison (except in cases of flying internationally or driving from nearby). Many travelers will find good options for less than that amount, and some will have to go over that amount. Our goal is to have everyone find a reasonable travel itinerary and not exceed our overall budget.\n\n\nWhen looking for a reasonable and cost-effective means to travel to and from Madison, here are a few ideas:\n\n\n\n\nWithin about 5 hours driving of Madison, consider driving or taking a bus; we can support \nall\n kinds of travel\n\n\nIf you fly, be flexible (within reason) about departure times \u2014 early and late flights are often the least expensive\n\n\nConsider flying into Milwaukee (1\u00bd hours away) or Chicago (2\u00bd hours away) and taking a direct bus to/from Madison (details below)\n\n\n\n\nIn any case, try to complete your travel plans by early June, before rates go up significantly.\n\n\nSee below for details about each travel mode:\n\n\nTravel by Airplane\n\n\nDo NOT buy your own airline tickets\n. University rules require the University\u2019s travel agency, Fox World Travel (FWT), to purchase your tickets.\n\n\nTo arrange flights to/from Madison:\n\n\n\n\nPrepare your travel information, requirements, and preferences:\n\n\nBasic personal information, including full legal name (as on government IDs), date of birth, and possibly a phone number\n\n\nTravel requirements, including starting and ending airport(s), hard timing constraints \u2014 preferences, such as not \nliking\n early flights, are different than hard constraints!\n\n\nTravel preferences, including timing preferences, airplane seating locations, and so forth \nIf you wish, you may search for (\nbut not purchase\n) flights ahead of time for your own information \u2014 but note that FWT may find different flights or may see different costs, and all tickets must be purchased by FWT and follow UW rules.\n \nIf flights to/from Madison are expensive, the FWT agent may check flights to/from Milwaukee or Chicago and bus schedules from those airports to Madison:\n\n\nBus between \nMitchell Airport\n (MKE) in Milwaukee and downtown Madison: \nBadger Bus\n (~$20 each way)\n\n\nBus between \nO\u2019Hare Airport\n (ORD) in Chicago and downtown Madison: \nVan Galder Bus\n (~$30 each way)\n\n\nBus between \nMidway Airport\n (MDW) in Chicago and downtown Madison: \nVan Galder Bus\n (~$30 each way) 2. \nContact Fox World Travel\n\n\nBy phone:\n Within the United States, use 866-230-8787 and select option 4; internationally, use +1\u00a0920-230-6467 and select option 4. \nTell them that you are part of Group Code 09UW1028.\n Agents are available Monday through Friday, 7:00 a.m. until 5:30 p.m. U.S. Central Time.\n\n\nBy email:\n Send to \n and \ninclude Group Code 09UW1028\n in the subject line.\n 3. \nIn most cases, FWT will need to get our approval for your itinerary before completing the purchase, so it may take up to a day to get final confirmation. Airplane seats cannot be held without purchase over a weekend, so it is best to avoid contacting FWT late on Fridays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n If you are including bus tickets as part of your flying itinerary, you may purchase them through FWT when you arrange your flights, or for maximum flexibility purchase them from bus drivers on the day of travel.\n\n\nTravel by Bus\n\n\nTypically, reasonable bus options \u2014 i.e., those that do not take an excessive amount of time to reach Madison \u2014 cost much less than air options.\n\n\nNote that you may purchase bus tickets through Fox World Travel (see above in the Travel by Airplane section) or yourself \nbefore or on\n the day of travel. If you purchase your own tickets, you must get our approval for the estimated cost first, then request reimbursement from us after the School.\n\n\nWhen you purchase your own tickets, save the original receipt (even if by email). It would be best if the ticket contains the following information, but a regular ticket stub (e.g., without your name or date) should work fine. Just get what you can! If possible, we would like:\n\n\n\n\nComplete itinerary\n\n\nYour name\n\n\nDate of purchase\n\n\nTotal amount paid\n\n\n\n\nBe sure to email us with your travel plans as soon as possible. Try to include:\n\n\n\n\nTransportation provider(s) (e.g., Van Galder bus)\n\n\nArrival date and approximate time\n\n\nDeparture date and approximate time\n\n\nArrival and departure location within Madison\n\n\nActual or estimated cost (indicate which)\n\n\n\n\nTravel by Personal Car\n\n\nIf you are driving to Madison, you will be reimbursed the mileage rate of $0.535/mile for the round-trip distance (as calculated by Google Maps), plus tolls. Also, we will pay for parking costs for the week at the hotel in Madison (but not elsewhere). It may help to keep your receipts for tolls.\n\n\nNote: Due to the high mileage reimbursement rate, driving can be an expensive option! We reserve the right to limit your total driving reimbursement, so work with us on the details.\n\n\nTo travel by personal car, please check with us first. We may search for comparable flight options, to make sure that driving is indeed the least expensive method.\n\n\nBe sure to email us with your travel plans as soon as possible. Try to include:\n\n\n\n\nDeparture date from home, location (for mileage calculation), and approximate time of arrival in Madison\n\n\nDeparture date and approximate time from Madison, and return location (for mileage calculation) if different than above\n\n\n\n\n2. You Are Paying for Your Travel\n\n\nIf you are paying for your own travel or if someone else is paying for it, go ahead and make your travel arrangements now! Just remember to arrive on Sunday before 6pm and depart on Saturday (or else check with us first).\n\n\nBe sure to email us with your travel plans as soon as possible. Try to include:\n\n\n\n\nTransportation provider(s) (e.g., airline)\n\n\nArrival date and approximate time\n\n\nDeparture date and approximate time\n\n\nArrival and departure location within Madison (e.g., airport, bus station, etc.)",

Airplane seats cannot be held without purchase over a weekend, so it is best to avoid contacting FWT late on Fridays.     Note:  If you are including bus tickets as part of your flying itinerary, you may purchase them through FWT when you arrange your flights, or for maximum flexibility purchase them from bus drivers on the day of travel.",

            "text": "OSG User School 2017 Final Assignment\n\n\nThe School focused on using high-throughput computing (HTC) to support and transform scientific inquiry.  Your final\nassignment is to apply your new knowledge to a challenge in your scientific domain that requires significant\ncomputation.  The assignment is useful, because it:\n\n\n\n\nReinforces and consolidates what you learned\n\n\nPrepares you to take real action on your large-scale computational challenge(s)\n\n\nDemonstrates the value of the School to our funding agencies and to your advisor, colleagues, etc.\n\n\nGuides us as we try to improve the School\n\n\n\n\nContent\n\n\nFirst, choose a challenge or project to present. An ideal topic:\n\n\n\n\nIs important to you and your advisor, team, department, or field\n\n\nRepresents work that is in progress or is planned to start soon\n\n\nRequires significant computational resources\n\n\n\n\nNext, think about your topic and how to apply what you learned during the School.  Think about how to approach the\ncomputational needs of the project using local HTC resources or the Open Science Grid (OSG).  We are not asking you to\nimplement the system! Just imagine how you would do it.  One approach is fine, but more than one approach is fine,\ntoo.  Imagine that you will run on the resources available to you at your own institution.  If your institution does not\nhave a HTC system available, then think about what kind of resources you would want or how you could get access to\nresources via the OSG.\n\n\nYour final assignment will be a written report (see below for more detail).

Below are some suggestions \u2014 feel free to answer some (or\nall) of them, or create and answer your own interesting questions:\n\n\n\n\nWhat local resources do you have access to?\n\n\nWould you use just local resources or do you need remote resources, too?\n\n\nHow would you turn your project into actual jobs?\n\n\nWhat are the resource needs of the jobs themselves?\n\n\nWhat sort of workflow, if any, would you use? Are there manual steps in your overall workflow? Could they be automated (e.g., with DAGMan)?\n\n\nHow much data do you need to move around? Which type of data situation do you have? What is your plan for data management?\n\n\nDo you think your project is better suited for HTC or HPC? Why?\n\n\nWhat security or privacy concerns do you have with your project? Do you need to do anything special regarding security?\n\n\nHow would your science be transformed by increasing the amount of computation you can use?\n\n\n\n\nFormat\n\n\nYou will write a short paper.  You can think of the format as an informal whitepaper, research paper, or proposal, if\nthat helps organize your paper.  Please represent yourself and your work well! Your final assignment may be posted on\nthe School website and hence be available to the public.\n\n\n\n\nThere are no precise length requirements, but 1000\u20131500 words is a good length to aim for\n\n\nPictures, charts, and diagrams are good, if they are appropriate and clear\n\n\nThe paper does not need to be journal-ready, but should be good quality and ready for public display\n\n\n\n\nSubmit your paper in as a PDF \u2014 no Word or LaTeX documents, please!\n\n\n\n\nIf you are not sure how to make a PDF, consult your department or campus IT staff for help\n\n\nEmail the PDF to the \n list\n\n\nIf the PDF is really huge, contact us and we will find another way to transfer the file (we \nshould\n be able to manage large data, right??)\n\n\n\n\nDeadline\n\n\nThe paper is due 31 August 2017.
